# Information Requirements

Information Requirements describe the information/data that the solution will manage. These are most easily and accurately described in text rather than tabular format, as follows:

- Patient demographic data, including identifying details such as name, age, data of birth, address, etc.
- Patient / event data – details of a patient’s interactions with the health system, including location, date and time, diagnostic details / codes, admission and discharge dates (if relevant), prescriptions, treatments, notes, vital signs, height, weight, BMI, outcomes, etc.
- NSW Health activity and performance reporting data.

The table below details where the data described above can be located.
