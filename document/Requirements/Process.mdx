# Process

## Elicitation

Requirements have been established by both formal and informal processes. Informal processes used include:

- Ad hoc discussions with stakeholders
- Conversation during steering committee and other meetings
- Background research
- Targeted discussion with relevant subject matter experts, via phone call, email and face to face.

Formal processes used have been:

- Interviews
- Questionnaires.

## Stakeholders

A stakeholder is an: "individual, group, or organization who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project" - (PMBOK 5th Ed, PMI, 2013)

The following stakeholders were involved in the requirements elicitation and analysis process.

## Requirements Prioritisation

The requirements will be prioritised based on the MoSCoW technique which divides the requirements into the following four categories:

| Priority Ranking    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **M - Must Have**   | Describes a requirement that must be satisfied in the final solution for the project to be considered a success                                                                                    |
| **S - Should Have** | Represents a high-priority item that should be included in the solution if it is possible. This is often a critical requirement but one which can be satisfied in other ways if strictly necessary |
| **C - Could Have**  | Describes a requirement which is considered desirable but not necessary. This will be included if time and resources permit                                                                        |
| **W - Won't Have**  | Represents a requirement that stakeholders have agreed will not be implemented in the current system, but may be considered for the future                                                         |
