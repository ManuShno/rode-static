# Security and Privacy Requirements

With the increase in opportunities to do business globally and the increased flow of information combined with the increase in sophistication of information security attacks, there is an urgent need to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

Security products provide protection against damage to information, but they need to be supplemented with a monitoring mechanism. An Information Security Management System (ISMS) helps determine how information is processed, stored, transferred, archived and destroyed. A secure ISMS is one which ensures:

- <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: only those who are authorised to see the
  information have access{" "}
- <strong>Integrity</strong>: accuracy and completeness of information is
  safeguarded by robust sourcing, processing, updating and storage
  processes{" "}
- <strong>Availability</strong>: authorised users have access to information and
  associated assets, in the required forms, when they need it.{" "}

The Standard ISO/IEC 27001 enables organisations to align with global Standards of best practice information security management. They offer organizations a practical framework and functional guidelines to assist with the improvement of information security and to be recognized accordingly – worldwide. ISO 27001 is now globally recognised as the standard against which organisations can be certified to.

In addition to any specific standards based requirements, the solution will need to comply with NSW Health’s Privacy Security Assessment Framework, or PSAF.
