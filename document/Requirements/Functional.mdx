# Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements describe capabilities the system will have in terms of behaviours or operations - specific information technology application actions or responses. The table below contains only high level requirements and will need significant expansion and additional detail, to be added during the next phase of the project, before it can be used as input to a design process.

| ID | Description | Priority Ranking |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| FN001 | The data environment must be able to ingest, transform and load routinely captured data sourced from multiple external systems, in different formats, into the common data model used for the repository | M |
| FN002 | The data environment should enable privacy-preserving linkage between related events, people and organisations from all ingested data | M |
| FN003 | Identifiable content data should be stored in a separate location to the linkage data | S |
| FN004 | Identifiable content data should be stored physically separate from content data of other data owners | S |
| FN005 | The system should provide a data dictionary to help researchers / stakeholders understand the nature of the stored data | S |
| FN006 | The data stored within the data environment must include metadata to enable the assessment of data sensitivity, and facilitate the data governance practices of the data owner, including granting or restricting access | M |
| FN007 | The system must provide functionality allowing the contents of the data environment to be queried, linked with related content from other data owners, and extracted to satisfy researcher requests. Data should be included in or excluded from query results, based on the type and value of data attributes, related metadata including, but not limited to, data source, data owner, data sensitivity, and data collection, and the specific permissions granted to the requesting researcher | M |
| FN008 | The system must provide audit reporting functionality, including the capture and/or generation, and maintenance of data on use and access specifically for audit purposes, including provisions for notification of actual or potential data breaches, or risks thereof | M |
| FN009 | The system must provide performance reporting functionality, including, but not limited to, the capture / creation and maintenance of data related to failures, up-time, and development processes | M |
