# Solution Requirements

Solution Requirements describe the characteristics of a solution that meet business requirements and stakeholder requirements. Note that this document currently addresses solution requirements in the areas of information and high-level functional requirements. Additional expertise will be required during the next phase of the project, to expand the functional requirements, and develop user, system and security requirements.
