# System (Non-Functional) Requirements

To be added during the next phase of the project - non-functional requirements capture conditions that do not directly relate to the behaviour or functionality of the solution, but rather describe environmental conditions under which the solution must remain effective or qualities that the systems must have (BABOK, 2015). This would include defining required characteristics in the areas of:

- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Supportability
- Etc.
