# User Interface

The role of the RODE User Interface in the RODE platform is to provide data access, data visualisation, data capture, and platform management of the RODE platform.

The RODE applications within the User Interface are grouped by theme or clinical specialty. Each application utilises the same backend services for data delivery and submission.

The user interface is secured using a custom security model and all data delivered via the RODE User Interface is specific to the permissions of the user making the request.

This allows all organisations using the RODE platform to have a standardised set of visualisations to simplify benchmarking and reporting.
