# Auditing
The logs of the system will be reviewed weekly by the system and a report of the error logs will be generated and accessible via the administration portal in the user interface.

These reports will identify the user, resource request, and error messages of all failed requests.

An email will be sent to all administrators with summary information related to the report. The information presented in the email will include a total count of errors, the prioritised list of services generating errors, and the time period of the errors.

The weekly error reports will be kept for a period of 52 weeks.
