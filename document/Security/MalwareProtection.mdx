# Malware Protection
The RODE platform has Static Asset Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Asset Security Testing (DAST) built into the Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CICD) pipeline for the deployment of services into the production environment.

All source code is monitored and checked for known vulnerabilities in all dependencies.

The RODE container definitions are stored within the native Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The ECR is only available from within the RODE Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration within the AWS environment.

All external traffic is routed through the NSW Health internet proxy.
