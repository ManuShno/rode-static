# Logging
## Clock Synchronisation
The RODE platform uses the UTC standard for system time and monitoring. 

Data values are stored in UTC format with reference to the timezone as a string representation.

## Client Logs
Each request to each microservice is appended to a log file mounted in a volume within the running container of the microservice. 

The log format follows the following format:
> utc datetime of request|request method:request uri|resp status|ip address|user uuid4

This information is enough to reproduce the request for auditing and data request reproducibility.

A separate log file will be created to monitor error logs for the daily period. The content of these logs will also include the response body of the request as a final pipe separated filed in the log format. The resulting format for the error log will then be:
> utc datetime of request|request method:request uri|resp status|ip address|user uuid4|error response body

## Logfile Settings
### Protection
The RODE logfiles are stored within [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic File System (EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) locations mounted as kubernetes volumes in the running microservice containers. There is one log file created per day and all operations are controlled via an append only process. 

Reading from the logs requires accessing the logs from within the query microservice which opens the logs files as read only when parsing the log files for the requested period.

### Retention
The log files are currently confgured to be stored indefintely within the AWS EFS.
