# Role Based Access Control
The roles associated with the RODE platform are detailed in the following table.

The RODE application manages access permissions at the levels of:
* Platform - the server infrastructure
* Application - the end user application
* Sub-application - the end user sub-application (domain specific)
* API - exposed researcher project APIs
* Extract - exposed registry APIs

The platform access is controlled via NSW Health Administrator accounts over VPN, and AWS IAM roles.
