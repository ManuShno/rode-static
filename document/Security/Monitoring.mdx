# Monitoring
The RODE platform uses the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Watch service for monitoring the configuration of the system infrastructure.

The kubernetes services are monitored with a prometheus service running within the cluster. The prometheus service is only available to traffic from within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration.
