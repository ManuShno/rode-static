# Load Service

**This project is part of proprietary software authored and controlled by [South Eastern Sydney Local Health District](https://www.seslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/services-clinics/directory/research) and [Manuel Nielsen](mailto:Manuel.Nielsen@health.nsw.gov.au).**

## Purpose

The RODE load service controls the transmission of data to the relevant data service sidecars for database interactions.

Every request is validated before processing with only the validated resources being processed.

## Design

The load service operates in the same namespace as the RODE services. The service is a long running asgi server that accepts RESTful operations from the client and the other micro services. The service will then control and erform all the relevant data loading requests to the database sidecars.

## Prerequisites

This microservice is dependent on the following packages.

## Volumes

The following volumes are designed for use within the microservice. The available tags are:

- PROD - production environment only
- DEV - development environment only
- ALL - required in all environments

| Volume     | Path    | Tags | Description                                                                                                    |

## Additional Documentation

Additional documentation for the technical implementation of the microservice please visit the Administration portal within the user interface. Authentication with the system will need to occur before this portal is available.

## Methods

The methods section details the http methods which are available for querying. These will then perform the background operations to perform data operations.

### Routes

The routes are the url routing rules for the method requests.

| Route     | Stage | GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE | Purpose                                                                                           |
| :-------- | :---: | :-: | :--: | :-: | :---: | :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /healthz  |  All  |     |      |     |       |        | The health check route that will be queried by the kubernetes health checks.                      |
| /base     |  All  |     |      |     |       |        | The route for testing the initialisation of the development environment.                          |
| /{entity} |  All  |     |      |     |       |        | The route by which http requests should be received for processing data within the RODE platform. |

### Post

The post method handler is responsible for the creation of new entities within the RODE system. If values exist then a metadata invalidation process occurs before performing the data insertion. This method should be the default for data insertion operations.

![Post Process](https://rode.forske.org/diagrams/load/post.drawio.svg)

### Put

The put method is responsible for the invalidation of existing values and the insertion of new data. This process is to be used for the editing of values within the data service. The use of this method retains the existing values to allow for data request reproduction.

![Put Process](https://rode.forske.org/diagrams/load/put.drawio.svg)

### Patch

The patch method is responsible for the editing of existing values within the data services. This method is only available to system administrators and will only ever be trigger by manual operations of the administrators.

![Patch Process](https://rode.forske.org/diagrams/load/patch.drawio.svg)

### Delete

The delete method handler is responsible for the end dating of the validity of existing values within the data services. Requests for data values that require purging will need to be submitted by the system administrators and require the inclusion of appropriate parameters. Purge requests will only ever be manually triggered by system administrators.
