**This project is part of proprietary software authored and controlled by [South Eastern Sydney Local Health District](https://www.seslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/services-clinics/directory/research) and [Manuel Nielsen](mailto:Manuel.Nielsen@health.nsw.gov.au).**

> _The Research & Operational Data Environment - **RODE**, aims to be a fully federated data environment, simplifying data governance processes, and providing best available process automation._

## Background

RODE was created within the [South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Research Office](https://www.seslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/services-clinics/directory/research) to provide data driven insights into research undertaken within the health district.

This first iteration of RODE created a single data repository using data from the Australian Research Ethics Database (AuRED) system. The initial goal of RODE version 1 was to provide a reporting solution for research activity within a New South Wales Local Health District.

[MindGardens](https://www.mindgardens.org.au/) provided the chance to form a strategic alliance to deliver our vision for a cross-jurisdictional data platform. This alliance afforded the creators of RODE the chance to design and implement a data platform that provides organisational specific data governance to all partners, while simultaneously delivering reporting solutions via a public facing web application.
