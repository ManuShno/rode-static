# Architecture

The RODE platform is designed following a microservice architecture. The RODE microservices are containerised: allowing for native hosting in the cloud; and, replicable to meet system demand.

## Infrastructure

RODE has been agreed to be hosted in the NSW eHealth AWS environment. The developer tools and storage options for the platform have been configured to use the native AWS system tools.

The AWS system tools follow a shared responsibility model - with AWS assuming the responsibility for the management and security of the underlying hardware and tools.
