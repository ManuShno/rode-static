# Entity

**This project is part of proprietary software authored and controlled by [South Eastern Sydney Local Health District](https://www.seslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/services-clinics/directory/research) and [Manuel Nielsen](mailto:Manuel.Nielsen@health.nsw.gov.au).**

## Purpose

The RODE entity service queries data from disparate data services and delivers a single data object for the resource. This is a RESTful service that relies on environmentally defined configuration files to define the available resources.

Every request is validated before processing with only the validated resources being delivered.

The entity service will deliver data in a standard application/json media type.

## Design

The entity service operates in the same namespace as the RODE services. The service is a long running asgi server that accepts RESTful operations from the client and the other micro services. The service will then perform all the relevant data fetching requests from the database sidecars and join the data for delivery as a single JSON object.

## Volumes

The following volumes are designed for use within the microservice. The available tags are:

- PROD - production environment only
- DEV - development environment only
- ALL - required in all environments

| Volume     | Path    | Tags | Description                                                                                                    |

## Additional Documentation

Additional documentation for the technical implementation of the microservice please visit the Administration portal within the user interface. Authentication with the system will need to occur before this portal is available.

## Methods

The methods section details the http methods which are available for querying. These will then perform the background operations to prepare data objects for delivery.

### Routes

The routes are the url routing rules for the method requests.

| Route                |    Stage    | GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     |
