# Purpose

The MINData Data Sharing Framework aims to enable MINData partner organisations to share appropriate, relevant health data in a **lawful, safe, and informed way** using the RODE (Research & Operational Data Environment) platform.

The purpose of data sharing can include but is not restricted to:

- Health research
- Clinical quality and safety
- Reducing clinical variation
- Collaborative service delivery and improvement
- Risk management
- Optimisation of the compliance of MINData partners with privacy and other regulations

The MINData Data Sharing Framework **does not** apply to:

- Use of the RODE platform or access to data for clinical patient care
- Use of data for purposes directly related to patient care

This MINData data sharing governance framework is intended to augment existing ethics and grant review practices as well as internal data governance processes. It provides a consistent, thorough, and informed approach to decisions about the sharing of data. This framework does not restrict an organisation from using its own data policies in any dealings external to MINData. However, it is required that in dealings between MINData partners this framework and the values here-in take precedence provided that legislative and ethical requirements are considered and met.

MINData acknowledges that data usage is made in the context of a partner’s core business requirements, which include support of research. MINData supports the streamlining of efficient data access and sharing across the partners in alignment with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), ‘Principles for accessing and using publicly funded data for health research’.

This framework covers the requirements for studies where personal health information is extracted from health data sources within MINData partners (including data linkage activities). Personal information and health information are defined in various privacy instruments. This framework deals with any information held by the MINData partner, be it health information and/or personal information or an opinion about a person that identifies or could identify that person.

**This framework is a living document, to be updated to reflect the future requirements of MINData partners as appropriate.**
