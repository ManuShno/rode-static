# Foreword

MINData is a commonwealth funded initiative linking patient level data across platforms and releasing anonymised linked data to clinicians, researchers, and analysts in real time.

At present seamless integration of research between partners with common interests in the fields of mental health, addiction medicine, and neurosciences is impeded by several factors that include:

- Working in fragmented silos, often with patient level data collected as patients move across platforms, invisible to each other
- Ensuring the efforts of data custodians in assembling complex datasets
- Protecting the identity and safety of the patient and the integrity of the partners contribution
- Cumbersome ethics approval and linkage efforts that do not lend themselves to rapid responses
- Non-standardised data definitions and uncertain data extraction capabilities

The redevelopment of the Randwick Health & Innovation Precinct allows opportunities for the MindGardens partners to assume a premier position on the precinct as a data driven research priority.

RODE is a modern distributed data platform specifically built to allow rapid real time data linkage across partner platforms while protecting the privacy of the patient and the knowledge base and data asset of the contributors. In doing so the value creation potential of the technology is self-evident as the data required to answer research questions can be rapidly delivered across the platform.

This framework has been developed by a working group drawn from facilities engaged in MINData. In consultation with them, it outlines the process by which agreements between MINData partners could be entered to meet this aim.
