# Application of the Framework

The MINData Data Sharing Framework are the principles by which the MINData partners are to adhere. The application of the values and ethos presented in the framework are to be enacted via standard operating procedures that are publicly available and developed in consultation with each of the MINData partners.

These procedures will provide the rules and guidelines for each aspect of data provision, data access, and interactions with MINData governance roles.

The standard operating procedures will augment and compliment MINData partners’ procedures for data handling and access. The MINData procedures are not intended to prevent a MINData partner from developing and implementing their own procedures.

The MINData procedures include but are not limited to:

- Management of data breaches
- Arbitration of partner disputes
- Restrictions on data usage
- Use of and access to Aboriginal and / or Torres Strait Islander specific data
- Patients’ rights and requests
- Use of contingent workers and third parties
