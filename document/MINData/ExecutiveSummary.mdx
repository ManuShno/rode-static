# Executive Summary

MINData is an initiative of the MindGardens Neuroscience Network and seeks to address this need by enabling research through cross institutional sharing of health data.

This data sharing will be done in a manner that is secure, legal, and ethical. Data sharing will always be highly respectful of patient privacy and the reason for the collection of the data.

On joining the MINData initiative the partner organisations agree to adhere to this framework, and to uphold the MindGardens principles. Collaboration between organisations must always be respectful and open.

This framework is intended to augment the data policies and practices of the MINData partner organisations and does not restrict an organisation in anyway regarding the handling and sharing of their own data outside of the MINData collaboration.

The governance of the MINData partnership is centralised in a governance committee comprised of representation from the MINData partners. This central committee is supported by an executive officer and the adoption of standard data governance practices.
