# Intellectual Property
Issues relating to intellectual property and commercialisation opportunities arising as a direct result of research activities under the MINData partnership are to be managed under the relevant MINData partnerâ€™s policies and procedures. The relevant organisation is determined to be the organisation that employs the creator of the intellectual property, or in the case of more than one creator, the organisation that employees the majority share of creators.

Where substantial data is used in the creation of the intellectual property the partners agree to the sharing of half the net proceeds with the data provider. If substantial data is contributed from more than one MINData partner half the net proceeds are to be divided by the data providers according to the share of data provided.

In the case where an organisation is the holder of the intellectual property and a data provider, they are entitled to a share of the net proceeds determined to be for data providers.

In cases where sharing agreements cannot be reached, the MINData governance committee can be utilised to arbitrate.
