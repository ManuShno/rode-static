The details here do not absolve any person or organisation from responsibility. It is intended as a guide, and the responsibility of data safety is the responsibility of each person and organisation. Other means may be employed to fulfill the requirements of the Five Safes.

**In all circumstances** it is required that for any data sharing to occur all legislative requirements are considered and met.

It is also acknowledged that there is a continuum of identifiable data and associated risks, all applications linking data are required to undertake an assessment of data identification risk.
