# RODE
MinData is primarily enabled by the Research & Operational Data Environment (RODE) platform.

RODE provides a means of data sharing and is compatible with other platforms and applications which enable data linkage and analysis. The RODE platform enables data owner control on data access through setting rules and conditions for data access.

RODE is a distributed / federated data querying platform which allows data to be drawn from multiple sources and analysed on a local computer while adhering to the rules and intentions of the MinData framework values and ethos. 

The data accessible via the RODE platform is defined by the data request and adheres to the requirements of the approved request.

Data can be accessed only by individuals registered as project participants and is held temporarily in the local system memory.

The use of RODE fulfills the *Safe Data* aspect of the Five Safes; however, it relies on the *Safe People* and *Safe Settings* aspect to be fully effective.
