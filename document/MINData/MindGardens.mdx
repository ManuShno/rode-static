# MindGardens

There is increasing concern within the community about the delivery and quality of health services for mental health, suicide prevention, drug and alcohol support, and brain disorders. General practice care, community care, and hospital systems are often disconnected, leaving vulnerable people to fall through the cracks. Opportunities to prevent issues arising or to intervene early are often lost because of this poor coordination.

MinData is an initiative of the MindGardens Neuroscience Network that seeks to address this need by enabling research through the cross institutional sharing of health data in a manner that is secure, legal, and ethical while remaining highly respectful of patient privacy.

MinData is aligned with and supports the MindGardens principles, in particular:

- Efficiently use and build upon existing service and research structures
- Promote innovation and research as core business
- Emphasize the expanding role of leading-edge technologies, especially in prevention
- Routinely measure outcomes that are important to patients’ lives
- Support the linkage of data from the partner organisations and external collaborators, to increase understanding of patients’ journeys
- Fully and quickly share results with the community and the health sector
