# Values and Ethos

MinData partners strive for mutually beneficial relationships between healthcare, and research; and recognise that an optimally productive relationship is built on good governance, common values and the trust that is thus enabled.

This section of the MinData framework discusses the values and ethos essential for the sustained, ability to share and utilise data quickly to maximise health-research success without compromising ethics or patient privacy.

Each organisation will foster a culture embracing the MinData values and ethos and encourage a culture of adding value to research and data by drawing on the skills and resources of the other partners.

## Value

> Investment in MinData is justified by mutual benefit.

The Chief Executive (or equivalent) of a MinData partner demonstrates willingness to commit resources to the full extent necessary to ensure that their organisation adds value to the partnership and does not draw on the resources of the collective while providing little in return.

## Collaboration

> Building and refining ideas, analysis, and results through readily including contributors.

When designing research studies each MinData partner should aim to include members of the partnership as a priority. The MinData partner services are to be consulted and invited to participate in the design of projects that seek to utilise the MinData data sharing partnership for data provision.

## Openness

> The sharing of ideas, discussions, and solutions benefit the partnership.

If researching similar subject matter, MinData partners will preferentially share outcomes and methods rather than compete.

## Accessibility

> Partners will make researchers and data mutually available.

The data sponsor of each MinData partner ensures that their organisation will not seek to circumvent the MindGardens principles, this framework, or the MinData standard operating procedures when accessing or using data from other partners.

## Respect

> The work and ingenuity of researchers, patientsâ€™ contributions and privacy provide value to the partnership.1

The data sponsor of each MinData partner will ensure that their organisation will not in any way abuse or disregard the trust and good will that allows for the collaborative data sharing to occur.

## Safety

> The safety and security of our patients and partners data is paramount.

The MinData collaborative partnership has adopted the use of the five safes framework.
