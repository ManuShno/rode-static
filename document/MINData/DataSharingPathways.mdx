# Data Sharing Pathways

This framework guides sharing of health data across MINData partners via the RODE platform.

This framework includes scope to include sharing of data across MINData partners external to RODE when necessary. Cross-institutional data sharing external to RODE cannot be considered low risk and must be assessed by an independent Human Research Ethics Committee.

Applications to share or utilise de-identified data relating specifically to Aboriginal and / or Torres Strait Islander communities must be submitted for review to the Aboriginal Health & Medical Research Council HREC in addition to other requirements.

## Primary Pathway

The primary data sharing pathway within the MINData partnership will be the provision of data via the RODE platform.

Applications to share de-identified (including linked data that has been de-identified) via RODE will be considered by the MINData Governance Committee.

## Alternative Pathway

The alternate pathways for data sharing and access within the MINData partnership are:

- Identified or identifiable data shared via RODE with consent of the data subject
- Identified or identifiable data shared via RODE without consent of the data subject

The alternate pathways only in circumstances which cannot be satisfied be the use of the primary data access pathway.

The MINData Governance Committee is not empowered to approve use or access to identified or identifiable data. Use of the alternate data access pathways must include separate HREC and Research Governance approval.

Requesting identified or identifiable data via RODE requires specific modification of the accessible data.

Where data sharing involves transfer of unit level patient data from a public health organisation, approval from the Public Health Organisationâ€™s Chief Executive or authorised delegate is required.

Projects seeking access must still notify the MINData Governance Committee of the project prior to commencement.
